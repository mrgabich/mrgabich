- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Geancarlo Abich, Ph.D. in Microelectronics @mrgabich
- ðŸŒ± Currently, I am assistant professor in the Computing undergraduation courses at the University of Santa Cruz do Sul. In addition, I am a Postdoctoral researcher in collaboration with the Microelectronics Group (GME) at Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS). 
- Academic background: I received the bachelorâ€™s degree in computer engineering from the University of Santa Cruz do Sul (UNISC) in 2014, the M.Sc. degree in computer science (PPGC) from the UFRGS in 2017, and the Ph.D. in Microelectronics (PGMICRO) from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS) in 2022.
- Experience: for the past seven years, I've been researching and developing tools involving the implementation and evaluation of reliable embedded systems based on resource constrained devices. My research activity focus on modeling and simulation of robust MPSoCs and deep learning approaches targeting resource constrained devices.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in developing tools to enable the deployment of Machine Learning models in resource-constrained devices and to explor the soft error reliability of such approach when considering the fault impact in both the system execution and the memory elements. Moreover, I am also interested in the modeling of virtual platform architectures, networks-on-chip, multiprocessor platforms. 

- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on research an development of Machine Learning models, soft error reliability, resource constrained architectures, IoT systems, MPSoCs, parallel processing, and embedded systems.
